# Flutter AES Encryption/Decryption App

## Overview

This Flutter application allows users to securely encrypt and decrypt text data using AES encryption. The app provides two main features:

1. **Encrypt Text**: Users can input a text and a secret key to encrypt the text using the AES encryption algorithm. The encrypted result is displayed, and users can copy it to the clipboard.
   
2. **Decrypt Text**: Users can input an encrypted text and a secret key to decrypt it. The decrypted text is displayed.

### Features

- **AES Encryption**: The app uses the AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) algorithm with a key and IV (Initialization Vector) for encryption and decryption.
- **Key Generation**: A user-provided secret is used to generate a 32-byte encryption key by appending a constant string to it.
- **IV Handling**: The IV is generated randomly for encryption and stored with the encrypted text for use during decryption.
- **Clipboard Support**: The encrypted text can be copied to the clipboard for easy sharing.

### Components

- **Text Input Fields**: Users can enter the text to encrypt/decrypt and provide a secret key.
- **Tabs**: The app has two tabs—one for encryption and one for decryption.
- **SnackBar Notifications**: Provides feedback for successful or failed encryption and decryption operations.
- **SelectableText**: Displays the encrypted/decrypted text, which can be copied by the user.

### Dependencies

- `flutter/material.dart`: Flutter’s material design package for UI components.
- `encrypt/encrypt.dart`: A package for implementing AES encryption and decryption.
- `flutter/services.dart`: A package for accessing system services like the clipboard.

### How It Works

1. **Encryption**:
   - The user enters a plain text and a secret key.
   - A 32-byte key is generated by combining the secret key and a constant string.
   - AES encryption is performed with the generated key and a randomly generated IV.
   - The encrypted text is displayed in Base64 format.

2. **Decryption**:
   - The user enters the encrypted text (in Base64 format) and the same secret key used during encryption.
   - The IV used during encryption is extracted from the encrypted string.
   - AES decryption is performed using the same key and IV to retrieve the original text.

### Instructions

1. **Encrypting Data**:
   - Enter the text you want to encrypt.
   - Enter a secret key.
   - Press the "Encrypt Text" button to encrypt the text. The encrypted result will be displayed below.
   - You can copy the encrypted text by tapping the "Copy Encrypted Text" link.

2. **Decrypting Data**:
   - Enter the encrypted text (Base64 format) and the secret key used during encryption.
   - Press the "Decrypt Text" button to decrypt the text. The decrypted text will be displayed below.
